# Experience and Advancement in Pathfinder Second Edition

As in most games, Pathfinder Second Edition uses a system of Experience Points (XP) to track character growth and power increases over time. Unlike in D&D and Pathfinder First Edition, Pathfinder Second Edition does not operate on a sliding scale of increasingly large experience point totals needed to advance. Instead, to gain a level, you spend a flat 1000 XP, whether you are 1st level or 30th, and XP rewards remain the same per encounter or plot no matter your level. 

XP rewards per plot are shared publicly on the wiki and may be reviewed there. Your current XP total is listed at the top of your character sheet. 

Note that you cannot `advance` if you are in an active encounter. Scenes are fine, but you cannot advance in the middle of combat.

## Commands

`listxp [<player>]`: View a history of your XP rewards and spends. Those with the _manage_alts_ permission can use the argument to see others' lists. Without it, it will display yours.
`advance`: Begins the advancement process. No modification to your sheet is made until you enter `advance/done`. 
`advance/review`: Your guidebook for what you get and the options you need to select. (Alias: `adv/review`)
`advance/raise <ability or skill> = <ability or skill to raise>`: If adv/review indicates that you have an ability or skill to raise, use this. It will automatically take the current value up one step, so no value specification is necessary, only the skill or ability.
`advance/feat <type> = <feat>`: If advance/review indicates a feat to select, use this. Dedication feats are selected with class (charclass) feats.
`advance/option <item> = <option>`: Some feats or class features require you to choose something else. Use this command to select those.
`advance/spell <spell>`: Selects a new spell. 
`advance/signature <spell>`: If advance/review indicates that this is needed, set a signature spell. 
`advance/done`: Locks your choices, takes you out of advancement mode, and updates your sheet.
