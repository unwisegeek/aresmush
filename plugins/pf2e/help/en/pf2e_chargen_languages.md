# Pathfinder 2E Chargen - Languages

Your choice of ancestry, the region you come from, and possibly your character class, will have offered you a set of starting languages. If your Intelligence modifier is positive, you can choose a number of additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier. Languages on Emblem of Ea come in three types:

* **Common**: These languages are widely spoken across Ea, and one might have come across knowledge of these languages anywhere.
* **Uncommon**: These languages are not widely spoken on Ea. They are either confined to a specific region, or are used by scholars and planar denizens. Starting characters may know one or two of these, but be sure to explain in your prologue how you came by this language.
* **Secret**: The secrets of these languages are carefully guarded, or their knowledge is lost to time. You cannot select these languages in chargen, and learning one will be the result of effort and RP on your part.
