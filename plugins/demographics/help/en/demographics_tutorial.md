# Demographics and Groups

**Demographics** represent your basic character info, like their hair and eye color. You can view the available demographics for your character by using the `demographics` command or the web portal (under Play -> Create a Character -> Demographics). For more information, see `help demographics`.

You can also assign your character to various **Groups** that are required in chargen. You can view the available groups using the `groups` command. Currently, Emblem of Ea has two groups: Faith and Region. You can view Faiths with `group faith` and Regions with `group region`. To set a group, use the `group/set` command. For more information, see `help groups`.

The main difference between groups and demographics is that groups show up in the [Census](/help/census) so you can see a breakdown of characters by group.  Also, groups have a fixed list of values whereas demographics are freeform.
