# Demographics

Demographics commands are used to set your character's basic physical information, like their hair and eye color. You can learn more about demographics in the [Demographics and Groups Tutorial](/help/demographics_tutorial).

Demographic commands (in-client):
`demographics` - Lists available demographics.

To set a demographic in your MU client, input the demographic followed by the value you want to set. For example, `eyes violet` will set your character's eyes to Violet.
