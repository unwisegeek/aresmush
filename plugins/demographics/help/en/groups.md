# Groups

During chargen, you can assign your character to groups of affiliation. You can more about groups in the [Demographics and Groups Tutorial](/help/demographics_tutorial).

Group Commands (in-client):
`groups` - List all group types.
`group <type>` - Shows options available for a group type.
`group/set <group type>=<option>` - Sets your group option for a group type.

Currently, Emblem of Ea has two groups: Faith and Region. In your MU client, you can input `group faith` and `group region` to see the Faiths and Regions lists. You can set your character's Faith with `group/set Faith=<faith>`, and you can set your character's Region with `group/set Region=<region>`.
