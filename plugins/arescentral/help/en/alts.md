# Alternate Characters

Alternate characters, or alts, are characters you create after your first character ingame. There are systems concerning alts. The primary one is our own alt registration system, which gives you RPP for every scene that you participate in. (We require you to register your alts; failure to do so may be grounds for dismissal from the game.) AresMUSH also provides an entirely opt-in secondary system called AresCentral, which allows you to link your characters on this game to an AresCentral player handle to create a profile that shows the characters you play across all AresMUSH games with AresCentral connectivity enabled.

AresCentral functionality is currently disabled in the playtest. In the full release of Emblem of Ea, we are limiting alts to **two per person**. This is to reduce server costs and to prevent a flood of character applications. However, registering alts to a handle allows you to gain Roleplay Points (RPPs) automatically for every scene that you participate in. When you reach a certain RPP threshold, the alt tracker code will let you register a new character.

## Emblem of Ea Alt Registration

Registering alts is easy! See [Registering Alts](/help/register), or `help register` in-client.

## AresCentral

AresCentral requires that you link characters to your AresCentral [player handle](/help/handle). Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, such as automatically tracking read forum posts and switching easily between characters on the web portal.

> Be aware that your handle is your OOC identity, shared across all Ares games. Having a handle and linking characters to it is always 100% optional! See [AresCentral](/help/arescentral) for more information, or `help arescentral` in-client.
