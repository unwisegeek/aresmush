    effect: You offer food, and an ordinary Tiny animal within range approaches to eat it. You imprint the image, direction, and distance of an obvious place or landmark well known to you within the animal. You can also attach a small object or note up to light Bulk to it. The animal does its best to reach the destination; if it makes it there, it waits nearby and allows nonhostile creatures to approach and remove the attached object. The spell ends after the message is delivered or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.%r%rIf there are no Tiny wild animals in range, the spell is lost.

    effect: You tap into the target’s senses, allowing you to see, hear, and otherwise sense whatever it senses for the spell’s duration. If the target wishes to prevent you from doing so, it can attempt a Will save, negating the spell on a success, but most animals don’t bother to do so. While tapping into the target’s senses, you can’t use your own body’s senses, but you can change back and forth from your body’s senses to the target’s senses using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.

    effect: You cause a length or section of rope or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands.' You can give it two commands when you Cast the Spell, and one command each time you Sustain the Spell.%r* Bind (attack) The rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (–20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target Escapes against your spell DC or breaks the rope. (A standard adventuring rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)%r* Coil The rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.%r* Crawl The rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.%r* Knot The rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.%r* Loop The rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.%r* Tie The rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.%r& Undo The rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.

    area: 10-foot emanation, which affects you
    duration: sustained up to 1 minute
    effect: You repel all magic from the target area, preventing spells and other magic from functioning. Spells can’t penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells—such as dispel magic—can’t affect the field itself unless they are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creature on the other side (as long as caster and target are both outside the field). A summoned creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and resume functioning when they exit the field; the ability boost from an apex item isn’t suppressed within the field. Spells of a higher level than the *antimagic field* overcome its effects, and can even be cast by a creature within the field.%rThe field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still functions as a longsword. Magically created creatures (such as golems) function normally within an *antimagic field*.

When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain the Spell, you can roll the orb, moving it up to 10 feet along the ground or the surface of a liquid. You can gain this effect multiple times in the same round by Sustaining the Spell multiple times. The orb can move through the spaces of any creatures or obstacles that wouldn't stop the flow of water. It extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its size or smaller, and it attempts to counteract any magical fires it moves through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can't counteract that fire for the duration of the spell.%r%rThe orb can also collect creatures it moves through. Any Large or smaller creature whose space the orb tries to move through can attempt a Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid being engulfed. If a creature succeeds at this save, it can either let the orb pass (remaining in its space or moving out of the orb's path into a space of the creature's choice) or allow itself to be pushed in front of the orb to the end of the orb's movement. The orb can try to Engulf the same creature only once per turn, even if you roll it onto a creature's space more than once.%r%rA creature that fails its save is pulled into the orb. It becomes grabbed, moves along with the orb, and must hold its breath or begin suffocating (unless it can breathe in water). An engulfed Medium or smaller creature and anyone trying to affect that creature follow the normal rules for aquatic battles. An engulfed Large creature is usually big enough that parts of it stick out from the water, and it can reach out of the water. An engulfed creature can get free either by Swimming with a successful DC 10 Athletics check or by Escaping against your spell DC. A creature that critically failed its Reflex save is further stuck and must attempt to Escape instead of Swim. A freed creature exits the orb's space and can immediately breathe. The orb can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.%r%rWhen the spell ends, all creatures the orb has engulfed are automatically released."

A creature that begins its turn in one of these lines or enters one of these lines on its turn takes 4d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save). A creature can take this damage only once per turn, even if it moves through several lines. Targets that are part of the *asterism* do not take damage from it. If the distance between two targets (or you and a target) ever exceeds 30 feet, the line of starlight between the two breaks, and any lines that now no longer have a direct path back to you also break.

Creatures trying to move through the wall fail to do so if they critically fail the save, ending their movement adjacent to the wall.

    effect: You prepare a spell that will trigger later. While casting *contingency*, you also cast another spell of 4th level or lower with a casting time of no more than 3 actions. This companion spell must be one that can affect you. You must make any decisions for the spell when you cast *contingency*, such as choosing a damage type for resist energy. During the casting, choose a trigger under which the spell will be cast, using the same restrictions as for the trigger of a Ready action. Once *contingency* is cast, you can cause the companion spell to come into effect as a reaction with that trigger. It affects only you, even if it would affect more creatures. If you define complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger might fail. If you cast *contingency* again, the newer casting supersedes the older.

    effect: With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of healing. The target recovers 3d8 Hit Points. You attempt to counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has, suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than removing it. The target is then temporarily immune to *delay affliction* for 1 day. You don't need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn't delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.

    effect: You loop a thought process in the target's mind, forcing it to repeat the same actions over again. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target fails, whatever actions the target uses on its next turn, it must repeat on its following turn. The actions must be repeated in the same order and as close to the same specifics as possible. For example, if the target makes an attack, it must repeat the attack against the same creature, if possible, and if the target moves, it must move the same distance and direction, if possible, on its next turn. %r%rIf the target can't repeat an action, such as Casting a Spell that has been exhausted or needing to target a creature that has died, it can act as it chooses for that action but becomes stupefied 1 until the end of its turn.

However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.
    heighten:

      4: As 3rd level, but you also pinpoint the source of the highest-level magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you don't learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).

If it sleeps the full 8 hours uninterrupted, when it wakes, it counts as having spent a day of downtime retraining, though it can't use dreaming potential for any retraining that would require either an instructor or specialized knowledge it can't access within the dream.

    duration: 1 minute
    effect: The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.

The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target and has the target's attack modifier, AC, saving throw modifiers, Perception, and skill modifiers, but it has only 70 Hit Points and lacks the target's special abilities, including immunities, resistances, and weaknesses. It has no magic items except weapon potency runes.%r%rThe duplicate gains the minion trait, and it can only Stride and Strike. Its Strikes deal the target's normal damage but don't apply added effects, since it doesn't have special abilities. The spell automatically ends if the duplicate's Hit Points drop to 0.%r%rThe duplicate attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. You can also try to give it additional instructions; when you Sustain the Spell, you can also Command a Minion as part of your action, but the GM determines whether the duplicate follows your command.%r%rThe duplicate is unstable, so each turn after it takes its actions, it loses 4d6 Hit Points. It's not a living creature, and it can never regain its lost Hit Points in any way.%r**Critical Success** You fail to create a duplicate.%r**Success** The duplicate deals half damage with its Strikes and the duration is reduced to a maximum of 2 rounds.%r**Failure** The duplicate works as described.

Within the ectoplasmic interstice, incorporeal creatures cannot pass through solid objects or corporeal creatures, and they can manipulate and attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures and objects. An incorporeal PC or other creature with a normal Strength modifier simply uses that modifier, but if the creature had a Strength modifier of -5, like most incorporeal monsters, it uses a +4 modifier instead, increasing its Athletics modifier by 9 accordingly. Attacks against creatures that are within the interstice overcome resistances as if they were by *ghost touch* weapons.

The target's body becomes stunned. While its body is stunned in this way, the target remains fully aware in soul form; it simply can't consciously move its body (though the body makes basic instinctual defensive movements). The target's soul has the incorporeal trait, is invisible, and has a fly Speed of 60 feet.

    range: 120 feet
    duration: 1 minute
    effect: Plants and fungi in the area entangle creatures. The area counts as difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save.

    effect: Your words fascinate your targets. You speak or sing without interruption throughout the casting and duration. Targets who notice your speech or song might give their undivided attention; each target must attempt a Will save. The GM might grant a circumstance bonus (to a maximum of +4) if the target is of an opposing religion, ancestry, or political leaning, or is otherwise unlikely to agree with what you're saying.%r%rEach creature that comes within range has to attempt a save when you Sustain the Spell. If you're speaking, *enthrall* gains the linguistic trait.%r%r**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and notices that you tried to use magic.%r**Success** The target needn't pay attention but doesn't notice you tried to use magic (it might notice others are enthralled).%r**Failure** The target is fascinated with you. It can attempt another Will save if it witnesses actions or speech with which it disagrees. If it succeeds, it's no longer fascinated and is temporarily immune for 1 hour. If the target is subject to a hostile act, or if another creature succeeds at a Diplomacy or Intimidation check against it, the fascination ends immediately.%r**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target can't attempt a save to end the fascination if it disagrees with you.

You can use Survival to Track through both air and water, noticing aerial or aquatic 'tracks' of all creatures who passed nearby in the last hour. It's more difficult to Track in this way: the DC to Track through air or water is always at least 30, or higher after precipitation or wind (in the air) or heavy tides or currents (in the water). It's possible to Cover Tracks against this spell, but creatures might not realize they need to do so."

You are quickened while inside the ward, and can use the additional action only to make nature's wrath Strikes. You are slowed 1 while outside the area.

You can't affect the Material Plane, and you can't be affected by the Material Plane except by force effects and abjurations originating there.%r%rWhen the spell ends, you return to the Material Plane. If you're in the air, you fall (unless you can fly), and if you're inside an object, you're pushed into the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet you were pushed.%r%rIf you cast this spell when not on the Material Plane, it is lost."
