For example, a steel sword transmuted to cold iron would deal additional damage to a creature with a weakness to cold iron.%r %rThis change is clearly magical and temporary, so the item's monetary value doesn't change; you couldn't transmute copper coins to gold and use those coins to purchase something or as a cost for a spell.

Each target must have enough space to expand into or the spell fails for that target. Each target gains the animal trait. Each target can Dismiss the spell's effects on themself.

Ignore any armor check penalty and Speed reduction.%r- 20 temporary Hit Points.%r- Speed 40 feet.%r- Low-light vision.%r- The following unarmed melee attacks, which are the only attacks the target can use. They're trained with them. When attacking with these attacks, the target uses their attack modifier with the proficiency and item bonuses of their most favorable weapon or unarmed Strike, and the damage is listed for each attack. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If the target's unarmed attack modifier is higher, they can use it instead. **Melee** [one-action] tusk (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 4d8+19 piercing; **Melee** [one-action] trunk (agile, reach 15 feet),**Damage** 4d6+16 bludgeoning; **Melee** [one-action] foot (agile, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 4d6+13 bludgeoning.%r- Athletics modifier of +30, unless the target's own modifier is higher.%r- **Trample** [three-actions] You move up to twice your Speed and move through the space of Large or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature takes damage from its foot Strike based on a basic Reflex save (DC = 19 + the target's level).

The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side (and dim light to the next 20 feet). Creatures other than you that come into the wall's light must attempt a Will save; they're dazzled for 1 round on a success, blinded for 1 round on a failure, and blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure. They are then temporarily immune to the blinding effect for 1 hour.%r %rA *prismatic wall* has seven different layers, each a different color. Red, orange, yellow, and green have the effect of a 5th-level *chromatic wall* spell of that color, and the others have the effect of a 7th-level *chromatic wall* spell of that color. A creature that tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against each component wall. The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the indigo and violet walls.%r %rThe wall as a whole is immune to counteracting effects of the wall's level or lower; each color must be counteracted by its specific spell, as described in *chromatic wall*. This must be done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can't be affected until the previous color is counteracted. Counteracting a color wall removes that color's effect from the wall, and counteracting them all ends prismatic wall. You can Dismiss the spell."

Though the lantern is insubstantial, you must keep a hand free to hold it or the spell ends (though using the hand for somatic spell components doesn't end the spell). Living creatures and undead in the area when you Cast the Spell, or that enter the area later, must attempt Fortitude saves. Living creatures that fail their Fortitude saves gain only half the normal benefit from healing effects while within the area. Undead targets that fail their Fortitude saves become enfeebled 1 while within the area. Once a creature attempts a save against *reaper's lantern*, it uses the same outcome if it leaves the area and enters it again.%r %rOnce per turn, starting on the turn after you cast *reaper's lantern*, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet.

Any mention of that name within the document becomes blurred, smudged, or otherwise completely illegible. Epithets and unambiguous references to the name are redacted as well; for instance, redacting the name of the god Maugrim from a book would also remove references to her title “the Tyrant.”

While it has regeneration, the target can't die from damage and its dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3), though if its wounded value becomes 4 or higher, it stays unconscious until its wounds are treated. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn.%r %rEach time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any).

Additionally, the material component must be a remnant of the item, no matter how small or insignificant (even a speck of dust that remains from *disintegrate* is enough). The spell fails if your imagination relied on too much guesswork; if the object would be too large to fit in a 5-foot cube; if the object still exists and you were simply not aware of it; or if the object is an artifact, has a level over 20, or has similar vast magical power.%r %rThe item reassembles in perfect condition. Even if your mental image was of a damaged or weathered object, the new one is in this perfected form. If the object was magical, this spell typically restores its constant magical properties, but not any temporary ones, such as charges or one-time uses. An item with charges or uses per day has all of its uses expended when remade, but it replenishes them normally thereafter.

    effect: You call upon the lost and forgotten, assailing your foes' minds with the memories of those who died with a grievance toward them. Enemies in the area take 6d6 mental damage (basic Will save) and are frightened 1 on a critical failure. If you know the names of anyone murdered or grievously wronged by an enemy in the area, you can chant those victims' names when you cast the spell to improve the clarity of the visions, increasing the damage to the corresponding enemy from 6d6 to 6d10; you can do so for multiple enemies if you know victims of each enemy. The visions are personal to each foe in the area, and you can't use this spell to discern a murderer by guessing a name. A creature that truly knows no one who died with any sort of grievance to that creature is immune to this effect.

    effect: Opening your mind to occult echoes, you gain impressions from past events that occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals psychic impressions from events that occurred over the course of the last day throughout the first minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next day back the next minute, and so on. These echoes don't play out like a vision but instead reveal impressions of emotions and metaphors that provide cryptic clues and details of the past. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent event through an impression, the spell ends unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC of at least 30 and possibly as much as 50, depending on the severity of the event. The GM determines whether an event is traumatic and chooses the DC.

If a creature falls against a solid object (such as a ceiling), it takes the appropriate amount of falling damage and lands on the surface. Once an object or creature reaches the top of the area, it floats, caught between the normal and reversed gravity. The creature can move along the plane where the two forms of gravity meet. Creatures that can levitate or fly can use those abilities to mitigate the effects of *reverse gravity*.%r %rWhen *reverse gravity* ends, all creatures and objects caught in the area fall back down. Likewise, anything that moves beyond the spell's area is subjected to normal gravity again.

    effect: "You cause the target to rapidly rust. This magical rust can affect nonferrous materials, but the target must be all or mostly metal. Skymetals such as adamantine and orichalcum are immune to this rust, and the GM might determine other precious materials are similarly resilient. Ultimately, the GM decides if an object or creature can be targeted with this spell. All damage from this spell ignores Hardness. If the spell causes persistent damage from rust, a creature can attempt to scrape off the rust to assist the target in recovering from the persistent damage (reducing the DC of the flat check to end persistent damage to 10 and granting an immediate flat check). The effect of the spell depends on its target.%r %r- **Creature or Hazard** A creature or hazard must be made of all or mostly metal to be affected (this includes many mechanical traps). The grasp deals 8d6 damage (basic Fortitude save), plus 2d6 persistent damage on a failed save. Touching a hazard to affect it with this spell might trigger the hazard, as determined by the GM.%r- **Item** The rust deals 2d6 damage, subject to a basic Reflex save by the creature wearing or holding the item; if the item is unattended, it automatically gets a critical failure. On a failed save, the item also takes 1d6 persistent damage. For an attended item, this persistent damage occurs at the end of the attending creature's turns; if the item was unattended when you Cast the Spell, the damage happens at the end of your turns.%r %rWhen targeting armor someone is wearing, its Bulk is 1 higher than the listed value, since carrying armor is more cumbersome than wearing it. Thin iron or steel items, such as weapons, have 20 HP and a Broken Threshold of 10, and thicker iron or steel items, such as most suits of armor, have 36 HP and a Broken Threshold of 18.

Though very unlikely, it's possible for a creature on the Ethereal Plane to stumble upon the chest.%r %rYou can Dismiss the spell to return the chest to your current location. If the spell ends by any other means, the container is lost on the Ethereal Plane and you can no longer recall it with this spell, though you could search for it in other ways.

    duration: 8 hours
    effect: You access the Shadow Plane, using its warped nature to spread your travels. The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection of the Material Plane). While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together).

You lose as many Hit Points as the target regained.%r %rThis is a spiritual transfer, so no effects apply that would increase the Hit Points the target regains or decrease the Hit Points you lose. This transfer also ignores any temporary Hit Points you or the target have. Since this effect doesn't involve positive or negative energy, *spirit link* works even if you or the target is undead.

    effect: A Medium guardian made of magical force appears and attacks foes you designate within range. The spiritual guardian is translucent and appears to be holding your deity's favored weapon.%r %rWhen you Cast the Spell, the spiritual guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied space next to a target within range (if necessary) and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Sustain the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though *disintegrate* automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's AC of 25.%r %rThe guardian's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian's weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual guardian's weapon is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.%r %rThe guardian takes up space and allies can use it when flanking, but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian.

    effect: A weapon made of pure magical force materializes and attacks foes you designate within range. This weapon has a ghostly appearance and manifests as a club, a dagger, or your deity's favored weapon.%r %rWhen you cast the spell, the weapon appears next to a foe you choose within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the weapon to a new target within range (if needed) and Strike with it. The spiritual weapon uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.%r %rThe weapon's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other statistics or traits of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual weapon is a weapon for purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.%r %rThe weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to it.
    heighten:
      4: The weapon's damage increases by 1d8.
      6: The weapon's damage increases by 2d8.
      8: The weapon's damage increases by 3d8.
      10: The weapon's damage increases by 4d8.

A stone's perspective, perception, and knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human's that it doesn't consider the same details important. Stones can mostly answer questions about creatures that touched them in the past and what is concealed beneath or behind them.

No more than one bolt can target any one creature. Each bolt deals 7d6 electricity damage (basic Reflex save).%r- **Rain and Wind** Heavy rain and whipping wind reduce visibility and mobility, making the area under the storm cloud difficult terrain and making everything seen within or through the area concealed.%r- **Thunderclap** Each creature in the storm must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 10 minutes. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to thunderclaps from *storm of vengeance* for 1 hour.

Creatures in the area take a -2 circumstance penalty to Acrobatics and Perception checks.%r- **Wind** Powerful winds buffet the area in all directions. Ranged attacks take a -4 circumstance penalty, and all flying is against the wind and counts as moving through difficult terrain.%r %rIn addition, once per round you can use a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, to call down a bolt of lightning, striking any target in range that you can see.

A creature must attempt a Will save if it's in one of the cubes when you Cast the Spell, or if it later enters one of the areas, with the following effects. A creature interacting with the illusion can also attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion, as normal.%r**Success** The creature disbelieves the illusion.%r**Failure** All terrain in the cubes is difficult terrain for the creature, including the air if the creature is flying, walls if it's climbing, and so on. When the creature would exit one of the cubes, it exits from one randomly determined by the GM. This is a teleportation effect. It can exit from any edge of that cube it chooses. When selecting a random cube, the GM excludes any that don't match the creature's terrain; for instance, if the creature were exiting along the ground, the GM would exclude any cube that didn't have an exit on the ground.

    effect: When someone has overindulged, you can hasten them past the worst of their affliction or intensify their misery. This spell attempts to progress a disease affliction, a poison affliction, or persistent poison damage affecting the target. If the target is affected by more than one of these, you can choose from among those you are aware of; otherwise the GM chooses randomly. An unwilling target can attempt a Will save to negate *take its course*.%r %rThe effect of this spell depends on whether you're attempting to end an affliction or persistent poison damage, and whether you are attempting to help or hinder the target's recovery.%r- **Affliction** The target immediately attempts its next saving throw against the affliction. You can grant the creature your choice of a +2 status bonus or a -2 status penalty to its saving throw against the affliction.%r- **Persistent Poison** You can cause the target take the persistent poison damage immediately when you Cast this Spell (in addition to taking it at the end of its next turn). Whether or not you do so, the target attempts an additional flat check against the persistent poison damage. You can set the DC of that flat check to 5 or 20 instead of the normal DC.

    effect: You grant the target corpse a semblance of life, which it uses to speak the answers to three questions posed to it. This spell calls on the physical body's latent memories rather than summoning back the deceased's spirit, so the corpse must be mostly intact for the spell to function. The more damage the corpse has taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers are, and it must have a throat and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has previously cast this spell on the corpse in the last week, the spell automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist answering the questions using the statistics of the original creature at its time of death, with the following effects.%r**Critical Success** The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions, and the target's spirit haunts you for 24 hours, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest for that time.%r**Success** The target can provide false information or refuse to answer your questions.%r**Failure** The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or attempt to stall so that the spell's duration runs out before you can ask all your questions.%r**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target's answers are more direct and less repetitive, though still cryptic.

Incorrect knowledge of the location's appearance usually causes the spell to fail, but it could instead lead to teleporting to an unwanted location or some other unusual mishap determined by the GM. *Teleport* is not precise over great distances.

You can slip through tiny cracks and don't need to breathe. You can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait, except those granted by this spell. You also gain the following effects based on your form.%r %r- **Air** You gain a fly Speed of 20 feet and become invisible while you are in the air. You can create the effects of a *gust of wind* from your space as a 2-action activity, which has the manipulate trait.%r- **Mist** You gain a fly Speed of 20 feet, and it becomes hard to see through you. Any creature on one side of your space who is targeted by a creature on the opposite side is concealed to the targeting creature.%r- **Water** You gain a swim Speed of 20 feet and become invisible while you are in the water. You can electrically charge yourself by taking a single action, which has the manipulate trait. If you do, you are no longer invisible in the water due to electricity indicating your location, but any creature that makes a melee attack against you takes 1d6 electricity damage; if it touches you, this is cumulative with the damage from your major curse.

If you created an effect with a duration that extends beyond the *time stop*'s duration, such as *wall of fire*, it immediately affects others again, but it doesn't have any of the effects that happen only when you first cast the spell.

    effect: You warp the structure of earthen material, turning rock into mud or mud into rock. Choose one of these two options when you Cast the Spell.%r %r**Mud to Rock** Mud in the area turns into unworked stone. If creatures are in the mud when it is transformed to stone, they must attempt a Reflex saving throw.%r**Critical Success** The creature escapes the mud and is atop the stone, unaffected.%r**Success** The creature climbs out of the mud as it turns to rock and is prone atop the stone.%r**Failure** The creature is partially stuck in the mud and is grabbed for 1 round or until it Escapes, whichever comes first.%r**Critical Failure** The creature is entirely stuck. It is restrained for 1 round or until it Escapes, whichever comes first.%r %r**Rock to Mud** You transform non-magical, unworked, and unattended stone in the area into an equal volume of mud. If you Cast this Spell on a stone floor, it becomes difficult terrain; if the resulting mud is at least 3 feet deep, it is greater difficult terrain, or the creature can try to Swim through it (DC 10 Athletics). If the mud is deep enough that a creature can't reach the bottom, the creature must Swim to move through it. If you Cast this Spell on a ceiling, the falling mud deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex save) and spreads out, creating difficult terrain in an area 10 feet larger in radius than the original spell's area. Once the rock is transformed into mud, the mud is non-magical and remains until natural conditions cause it to dry out or otherwise disperse.
