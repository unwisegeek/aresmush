  approval_message: Congratulations! Your character has been approved for play. Type %xhonstage%xn
    to go forth and RP. Don't forget to customize your character profile on the webpage and upload
    a character icon, if you have not already done so.
  arrivals_category: New Arrivals
  bg_blurb: The prologue is your character's story up to the point where they join the 
    Illuminators. It does not need to be a novel, but should identify key themes, tie
    your ancestry, heritage, background, and class together, and suggest a possible
    direction for the character's story. That direction is not set in stone and can
    change as your story progresses.
  demographics_blurb: "Demographics record your basic character info. Don't worry about 
    class, level, or ancestry here; you'll set that when you do your sheet."
  desc_blurb: You can set both your main description, visible when people look at
    you, and a short description that shows your character at a glance. Like your
    prologue, this does not have to be (and shouldn't be) a novel, just enough to
    get a sense of what your character looks like.
  groups_blurb: Groups determine your character's affiliations.
  hooks_blurb: RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can
    hook into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character
    has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you. Looking
    around at other characters' profiles can be a good way to get inspiration for RP
    Hooks.
  hooks_required: true
  icon_blurb: Your profile icon appears in scenes and the character gallery to show
    your character at a glance. Providing a profile icon is optional. You can upload
    additional character images once you're approved for play.
  lastwill_blurb: The fate of idled-out characters is at the game admin's discretion,
    but you can register a preference with your character's 'last will'. You may ask
    to be killed off, turned into an NPC, wander off into the wilderness, and more. 
  permissions:
    manage_apps: Approve and reject character apps.
    view_bgs: Can view other characters' backgrounds.
  post_approval_message: Please make sure they have a profile image for their log
    icon.
  rank_blurb: This game does not use ranks.
  registration_blurb: This game requires that players disclose their alts privately
    to game admins. See `help register` for more information.
  rejection_message: Sorry, your character could not be approved at the present time
    for the reasons described in the following text. Please see %xhhelp app%xn for 
    help making changes and resubmitting, and contact the person handling your 
    application if you have any questions.

      title: Chargen Commands
      text: You can do most of chargen either on the web portal (help web portal) or in-game.  
        They both have the same information - it's just a matter of preference. If you
        choose to use the in-game chargen, the %xccg%xn command will walk you through
        the necessary steps. You can go back and forth through the steps of chargen
        as much as you want using %xccg/next%xn and %xccg/prev%xn.%r%rAt this time, 
        Emblem of Ea does not support sheet generation on the web; you'll need to log into 
        the game in a supported client to do that part.
    app:
      title: App Review
      text: The `app` command is your friend during chargen. It will alert you to
        things you may have forgotten to set. %xrRed%xn issues will almost certainly
        prevent your character from being approved (like forgetting to set your eye
        color). %xyYellow%xn issues are warnings; they might actually be OK if it
        fits the character concept.

      title: App Submission
      text: You've completed chargen! Review your app one more time, and use `app/submit
        [<optional notes>]` to submit your character when ready. The admins will
        make sure it's a good fit for the game's theme, that your sheet is in line
        with your prologue, and that you have not minmaxed or "dumpstatted". See
        `help apps` for additional help on the app review process.
