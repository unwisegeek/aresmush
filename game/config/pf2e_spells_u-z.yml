    - somatic
    - verbal
    duration: 1 hour
    effect: You disguise the targets as other creatures of the same body shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise can hide the targets' identities or let them appear to be of another ancestry, but it's not precise enough to impersonate specific individuals. The spell doesn't change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for each target; for example, you could make one target appear to be a dwarf and another an elf.%r %rCasting *veil* counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of the Impersonate action. It allows the target to ignore any circumstance penalties they might take for being disguised as dissimilar creatures, and it gives the targets a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their disguises, and add their level even if untrained. You can Dismiss any or all of these disguises.
    heighten:
      5: The spell also disguises the targets' voices and scents; it gains the auditory and olfactory traits.
      7: The targets can appear as any creature of the same size, even specific individuals. You must have seen an individual to reproduce their appearance. The spell also disguises the targets' voices and scents; it gains the auditory and olfactory traits.

    cast:

    duration: 10 minutes
    effect: You craft a 20-foot-tall wall of living flesh in a straight line up to 30 feet long. The wall is 3 feet thick, and each 5-foot-long section has AC 10 and 75 HP. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller length or height. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall can't be Repaired but can be healed by positive energy and healing spells and abilities.%r %rWhen you Cast the Spell, choose one of the following features for your wall.%r- **Arms** The wall is a mass of grasping arms. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall must attempt a Reflex save.%r**Success** The creature is unaffected.%r**Failure** The creature is grabbed by the wall for 1 round or until it Escapes against your spell DC, whichever comes first.%r**Critical Failure** The creature is restrained by the wall for 1 round or until it Escapes against your spell DC, whichever comes first.%r- **Eyes** The wall sprouts hundreds of unblinking eyes. You can see through these eyes, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to visual Perception checks within the wall's line of sight. You can also use the eyes for determining line of sight for ranged attacks and spells, but you don't have line of effect through the wall.%r- **Mouths** The wall has countless toothy mouths along its surface. The mouths Strike any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall, using your spell attack roll for these Strikes and dealing piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The mouths are capable of consuming potions; since the wall is alive, it can recover Hit Points from a potion of healing, but it can't benefit from any effect that would give it the ability to move. Otherwise, the GM determines which potions can affect the wall.

You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, Hardness 30, and 60 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage.

You create either a 1-foot-thick wall of ice in a straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high (the wall doesn't have to be vertical, but it must be anchored on both sides to a solid surface) or a 1-foot-thick, 10-foot radius hemisphere of ice. The ice that makes up the wall is opaque. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller length, height, or radius. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.%r %rEach 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, cold damage, and precision damage. A section also has weakness to fire 15; a section of the wall destroyed by fire melts, evaporating into water and steam. A section destroyed by means other than fire leaves behind a chilling mass of ice that is difficult terrain and deals 2d6 cold damage to any creature passing through it.

You can shape the wall's path, placing each 5 feet of the wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn't need to stand vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. You must conjure the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.%r %rEach 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 50 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage.

You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall stands vertically. If you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or height. Everything on each side of the wall has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the wall's spaces are difficult terrain. For every move action a creature uses to enter at least one of the wall's spaces, that creature takes 3d4 piercing damage.%r %rEach 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 20 Hit Points.

The wall stands vertically, but you can shape its path. Though the wall of wind distorts the air, it does not hamper sight. The wall has the following effects.%r- Ammunition from physical ranged attacks—such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and other objects of similar size—can't pass through the wall. Attacks with bigger ranged weapons, such as javelins, take a -2 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths pass through the wall. Massive ranged weapons and spell effects that don't create physical objects pass through the wall with no penalty.%r- The wall is difficult terrain to creatures attempting to move overland through it. Gases, including creatures in gaseous form, can't pass through the wall.%r- A creature that attempts to fly through the wall using a move action must attempt a Fortitude save.%r**Critical Success** The creature can move through the wall normally this turn.%r**Success** The flying creature can move through the wall this turn, but the wall is difficult terrain.%r**Failure** The wall stops the movement of the flying creature, and any remaining movement from its current action is wasted.%r**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is pushed 10 feet away from the wall.

    effect: An immense weapon of force appears, hovering in the air above the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of your deity's favored weapon. Name war or peace when you cast this spell.%r %rIf you name 'war,' mentally choose one creature. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. The target instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target's turns, if the target did not use a hostile action against the creature you chose during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target.%r %rIf you name 'peace,' mentally choose up to five allies. The target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action against you or one of your allies. The weapon Strikes only once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies (such as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike).%r %rStrikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout the target's turn, but its penalty is separate from yours.%r %rWhen the weapon Strikes, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types, for a versatile weapon). No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.%r %rThe weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.

    effect: You infuse yourself with primal essence and transform yourself into another form. You can polymorph into any form listed in *pest form*, which lasts 10 minutes. All other *wild shape* forms last 1 minute. You can add more forms to your wild shape list with druid feats; your feat might grant you some or all of the forms from a given polymorph spell. When you transform into a form granted by a spell, you gain all the effects of the form you chose from a version of the spell heightened to wild shape's level. *Wild shape* allows you to use your own shapeshifting training more easily than most polymorph spells. When you choose to use your own attack modifier while polymorphed instead of the form's default attack modifier, you gain a +2 status bonus to your attack rolls.

      2: You can also wild shape into the forms listed in *animal form*.

While the spell persists, as long as you can see the night sky and the target is visible from the same night sky, you can sense the approximate direction and distance to the creature by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This is exact enough to track the creature, but not pinpoint their exact square (for instance, to make an attack).
